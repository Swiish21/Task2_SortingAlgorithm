These two files are two sorting algorithms, one is a quicksort algorithm, the other is a merge sort algorithm.
The main aim of these programs is to sort a list of given integers and return a sorted list upon completion
Comparing the two, I'd suggest that the quicksort algorithm is the faster of the two because it takes fewer steps to complete the same task that a merge sort algorithm does.
