This repository contains two different dart files that tackle two different sorting problems

File 1: sort_alg tackles a quicksort challenge where we are required to implement a quicksort algorithm to sort an unordered list of integers, the program defines a funtion that has a list parameter, if the amount of items in the list is less than or equal to 1, the program returns true because a list 0 or 1 items is technically sorted. If not we define a pivot element(the one we'll to compare and sort the list with), in our case the pivot element is 0, we create two more lists onje for values greater than the pivot element and one for values lesser than the pivot element, we create a for loop that starts from 1 (because zero is already in use as a the pivot), it will compare the value of i (which changes with each iteration) to the pivot element, if greater than the PE it will be sorted into the greater list, if less, into the less list, after the loop is done going through the unordered list.
it combines the less than list, pivot and greater than list in that respective into a single ordered list, we then print out the final ordered list and the program stops.

File 2: sort_alg2 tackles the same problem(unordered list) but with a different algorithm, a merge sort algorithm, we start by defining a mergesort function with one parameter which is the list we want to sort. In the list we created an if statement to check if list length is less than or equal to one, if yes it means it's already sorted, hence no need to run the algorithm. If not we continue the algorithm by taking the list and dividing it into 2 equal parts, we define a midpoint(middle) of the list. We define the left side of the list as a sublist and the same to the right side. we create another funtion that will merge the two sublists after they are sorted, in the list we create an empty list, to store the sorted list, we create two pointers i and j to help go the two sublists. We use a while loop to iterate through, the condition for the while loop is that as long as the value of i and j are less that their respective sublists(to ensure we go through every element) in the loop we use if statement to compare the values of i and j, if the condition is met the element is added and sorted to the left sublist, if not it's added to the right sublist, added a few lines for the case where one sublist is longer than another the rest of the elements are added to complete the list. We then return the full sorted list. And print it.
